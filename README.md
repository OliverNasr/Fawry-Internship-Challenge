# ðŸ›’ Fawry E-Commerce System (Internship Challenge 3)

A modular, object-oriented e-commerce system built in Python as part of the **Fawry Rise Journey Full Stack Internship Challenge**.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project simulates an e-commerce platform with features like:
- Custom and default product management
- Product types: expirable, shippable, or both
- Customer balance management and cart system
- Shipping cost calculation
- Checkout with detailed receipts

It demonstrates core object-oriented principles and simulates realistic e-commerce checkout logic.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Add customers with specific balances  
- Add predefined and user-defined products  
- Support for:
  - Expirable Products (e.g., Scratch Cards)
  - Shippable Products (e.g., Cheese, TV)
  - Expirable + Shippable Products (e.g., Fresh Milk)
- Add items to cart with quantity checks  
- Validation for:
  - Expired items
  - Empty cart
  - Insufficient balance
  - Out of stock items
- Dynamic checkout summary with shipping details

## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation** â€“ Controlled product access via properties  
- **Inheritance** â€“ Base and specialized product classes  
- **Polymorphism** â€“ Shipping behavior via shared interface  
- **Abstraction** â€“ Use of abstract base `Product`  
- **Modular Design** â€“ Separated class responsibilities
